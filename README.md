# Software Engineering Python Course Labs

## Environment Setup

Different labs require different dependencies. There are a couple of ways to run the code:

- Clone the code locally, install required python packages and other dependencies.
- Run the code inside GitHub Codespaces or locally using dev containers.

To run the code with Codespaces: Navigate on green "Code" button -> Codespaces -> Create new codespace on \<branch\>

This should open the codespace in new window and install all required dependencies into the container.

## Course work

Laboratory work is divided into 5 parts, each part has it's own branch.

1. Lab1: simple intro to popular Python libraries.
2. Lab2: Python together with MongoDB.
3. Lab3: Python unit testing.
4. Lab4: Python extension with C and embedding into C.
5. Lab5-alternative: plotting geographic data.
